<h1>Personal Paths</h1>
<p>The personal path system is a method for delivering a series of online lessons which are known as activities. Each activity focuses on a specific topic, and they build on each other.  Each activity relays information about a given subject through the use of different types of steps, or the pages which path participants view inside an activity. Activities can contain text, videos, images, and discussion questions.</p>
<h2>Path Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Path subscriptions are given to new members automatically if they join a team which has been granted access to a path. The join code plays a part in granting members access to the path system in that it allows them to join a team and/or a specific group within that team, but the path subscription and other settings are managed independently of membership inside a group or a team. In fact, the current path system is designed such a way which allows users to continue working on their path even after they have left a team.</p>
<h2>Launching Your Path</h2>
<p>Launch your path by clicking on the link “Path” inside the main navigation menu. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Students will also be able to use the link in the site’s main navigation to launch their path again if they happen to exit out. Students are automatically taken into their path each time that they log into their account on the site.</p>
<h2>Interacting with Path Activities</h2>
<p>There are a number of elements and controls which you can use as you are navigating through an activity in the path.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Progress Bar</b> - The progress bar shows you how far you are in the current activity. It will reset each time that you start a new activity.</li>
<li><b>Left/right navigation</b> - You can move backwards or forward by clicking on either the right or the left arrow. On discussion steps, the forward arrow will become active after you’ve entered a response which meets the step’s minimum word count.</li>
<li><b>Media Content Area</b> - The side of the step will display any media content, such as videos, images, graphs, or additional text. When it’s not being used, a watermark will appear.</li>
<li><b>Comment form</b> - This is where users can enter their response to the step’s message or questions.</li>
<li><b>Word minimum counter</b> - By default, the step will display the word count minimum for any response that’s asked for by the step. As the user types, this number will go down. When the counter reaches “0,” they have reached the minimum and will be able to submit their answer.</li>
<li><b>Plus submit button</b> - When you’re ready to submit  your response, you can either hit the enter button or click on the plus submit button. Your comment will be saved and appear below the step’s message.</li>
<li><b>Message area</b> - The text with the blue button is the step’s main message.</li>
<li><b>Hamburger Menu</b> - Click on the hamburger menu icon over on the left hand side to expand the path menu.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Path Journal</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Both Students and Coaches can review their path progress or revisit an activity from their Path Journal. This section of the path is available by clicking on the link “Path Journal” inside the menu on the left hand side of the Metrics, Path, Group Management, Coach Management, or Member Management section.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/null-3.png" width="624" height="332" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>From inside the Path Journal Page, you can expand the list of steps that are contained within each activity by clicking on the plus symbol next to each activity title. Click on an activity’s title or on the step text to jump directly into that spot within the path. The Path Journal only shows you the activities and steps that you have completed, and the activities are listed in chronological order.</p>
<p>When you have jumped into your path history, you can jump back to your current uncompleted step by opening up the path side menu and clicking on “Continue Path.”</p>
<h3>Path Preview</h3>
<p>Coaches can also preview the activities in the path by clicking on “Path Preview” in the side menu. While in preview mode, you can view the content of any activity which has been available to you via your subscription, but your progress isn’t saved, and if you post a response in a step your text will not be saved. Path preview is meant to be a way of looking ahead in the path for planning purposes.</p>
<p>When you are ready to return to your path, you can click on “Continue Path,” or you can exit the path by clicking on “Metrics.”</p>

<h3>Modifying students’ Path settings</h3>
<p>It may be occasionally necessary to adjust your students’ path settings. This can be done from the Member Management screen from within the Metrics area.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/null-5.png" width="624" height="332" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>From the member management page, click on the three vertical dots next to the student who you would like to modify. Then, click “Edit Membership.”</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/null-6.png" width="624" height="332" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Look for the “Path Settings” header towards the bottom of the edit membership page. From here, you can adjust the student’s experience by changing their minimum words level and raising or lowering their daily activity limit.</p>
<h4>Daily Activity Limit</h4>
<p>The daily activity limit is the function which prevents students from moving too far ahead in the path. The value in the field represents the number of new activities they can start per day. If the daily activity limit was set to “1,” the student would only be able to complete one activity before the system tells them that they are done for the day. If the student is in the middle of a previous activity, then the system would allow them to start one more activity before telling them that they are done for the day.</p>
<p>A change to the daily activity limit only affects the student account that you are adjusting under the Edit Membership page. EduGuide staff are able to adjust the limits for all of the students on your team.</p>
<h4>Minimum Word Requirement setting</h4>
<p>Each discussion step is assigned a minimum word requirement at either a high, medium, or low level. When enabled, the minimum word count requirement encourages students to write responses that are more complete. When the student first views a discussion step, the minimum word count will be displayed next to the discussion respond field. As the student begins to write their response, the counter will count down to zero. Once it reaches 0, the submit button will become enabled and the student will be able to submit their response and continue on to the next step in the activity.</p>
<p>Coaches are able to adjust students’ word count minimum setting in their edit membership page. Under “Minimum Words,” select a level that most closely fits that particularly student, and then save. The new settings will be saved.</p>
<p>You can also set the word count minimum as “No minimum.” This will turn off this functionality for the student.</p>
