EduGuide is looking for volunteer interested in participating in a beta test assignment which involves completing a course of online curriculum. You will join as a student and complete one online lesson per day. You will also interact with other testers who are serving as coaches on the team.

As a part of your participation, you will be asked for feedback on your experience including:
<ul>
 	<li>The content in the online lesson</li>
 	<li>Effectiveness of any email reminders you receive</li>
 	<li>The registration and login experience</li>
 	<li>Your overall impression of the site</li>
</ul>
You can register for this assignment by completing the following form. Contact Jon Morgan, Web Services Manager, with any questions you have about the assignment at <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.
