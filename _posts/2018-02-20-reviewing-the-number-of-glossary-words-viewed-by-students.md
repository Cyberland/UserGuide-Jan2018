<h1>Reviewing the number of glossary words viewed by Students</h1>
<p>A view in Metrics allows you to monitor the number of words that students have saved to their personal glossaries. When students highlight a word in a path activity, a definition for that word will appear. Each word that they define is saved to their personal glossary.</p>

<h2>Viewing Words Learned</h2>
<p>From inside the Metrics page click on “Words Learned” inside the list of available metric views located on the far left hand side and towards the top of the page. The view will change so that you are shown the number of glossary words which have been saved by each student. The first row will show an average for the total number of users included in your current filter.</p>

<p>Click on the bar graph icon next to the header to view the total number of words which have been saved to glossaries by the users included in your current filter.</p>

<p>You can view an individual student’s personal glossary by clicking on their name in the list. A list of the words they’ve saved to their glossary will appear. You can page through the list of students quickly by clicking on the right and left arrows located towards the top of the page. To return to the list of students click on the “x” located to the far left hand side of the page.</p>
