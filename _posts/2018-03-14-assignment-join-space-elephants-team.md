<h2>Purpose</h2>
I am currently testing a new views in our Metrics feature on staging. I wanted a new set of stats, so I started a new team on the staging site called “Space Elephants”
<h2>Assignment</h2>
I need a few user testers to join the Space Elephants team and take the following action:
<ul>
 	<li>Complete one or two steps inside the Team Setup page</li>
 	<li>Complete 2-4 activities in the path</li>
 	<li>Respond to others in Metrics</li>
</ul>
Or, if you join as a student complete the following steps:
<ul>
 	<li>Complete 1-3 activities in the path (may take more than one day)</li>
 	<li>Look up 5 words in the path content by highlighting or double clicking on a word</li>
 	<li>Respond to coaches’ comments in your path</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
Use the link below to sign up to join the test team. I will send you an invitation and/or instructions on how to join. You will either join as a coach or a student.
