You can adjust the volume of emails you receive by enabling or disabling specific categories of notifications under your Personal settings page inside your EduGuide account. You can access your personal settings page from anywhere on the site by clicking on “My Settings.”

Towards the bottom of the page, there is a list of the different notifications that are offered by the site. They are broken into the categories of Global, Dashboard, and Teams. Notifications which have a check in the checkbox next to their titles have been enabled. Clicking removes the check and disables them.

Students can also choose the notifications that they receive via email, although they will see a shorter list of choices.
<h2>Changing your Email address</h2>
You can also change your email address from inside the “My Settings” page. Clicking on “Change Profile” will reveal a form which contains your current name, email address, password, and phone number. Make any necessary changes and then click “Update” to save.
<h2>Mobile Notifications</h2>
SMS notifications have been made available to some teams. They can be disabled from My Settings by unchecking the box next to the option “Enable mobile notifications.” There is also a field which will display the mobile phone number that is associated with your account.
