Students sometimes are able to join the site without becoming a member of their school’s team. This can also be the result of a student having been removed from their team. Here are some steps coaches can take if they want to add a student with an existing account to their team.
<h2>Students’ process for joining the site</h2>
Students will successfully join your school’s team if they navigate to http://join.eduguide.org, and include a join code when they complete the registration form. After they register, an account will be created and they will be added to the appropriate group inside your team.
<h2>Determining the student’s Team Membership status</h2>
You can tell that a student hasn’t been added to your team if you notice the following:
<ul>
 	<li>The student is not taken into their path automatically after they login. Instead, they might be taken to their personal dashboard when they login.</li>
 	<li>The student is not listed on the Members page. You can determine this by running a visual search, or by adjusting the filters on the page.</li>
</ul>
A variation of this issue is that the student has joined the site, but they are on the wrong team. Students should not be able to access the pages within a team, so if you notice that one of your students is able to view a team dashboard or pages that a coach can sometimes view, their account may need to be adjusted. EduGuide’s Helpdesk can work with you on a resolution.
<h2>Adding a student to the team</h2>
Students can still join your team by entering in your group’s join code when they next log into the site. If they are currently logged in, ask them to log out using the link in the main navigation menu. Then, direct them to go to http://login.eduguide.org. On the login page, there is a link below the login button labeled “Have a code?” Clicking this link will reveal a field where they can enter in the join code. Upon logging in, they will be added to your group and then taken to their path.
