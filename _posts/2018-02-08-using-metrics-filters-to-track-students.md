Metrics is the page where coaches can track their students’ progress in the path..
<h2>Metrics Page Overview</h2>

There are a few new additions that are easy to spot when you land on the metrics page. When you click on each filter control, the menu that appears is labeled. There is also an additional row of information which is displayed in a blue bar at the very top of the page which will show averages based on the current filter settings.

<h2>New Views</h2>
Three new views are available in the menu located to the far left hand side of the page:
<ul>
 	<li>Coaching Received</li>
 	<li>Coaching Given</li>
 	<li>PD Activities</li>
</ul>
Each view has its own unique functionality.
<h3>Coaching Received</h3>
This view will show you a list of members based on the filters entered, and then the number of comments that have been posted inside their path.

<h3>Coaching Given</h3>
The Coaching Given view displays only coaches, and will show the number of comments they’ve posted inside students’ paths.

Under the Coaching Given view, you can view a list of the members who each coach has responded to by clicking on their name. When you click on a coach’s name, you are taken to a separate page showing a list of the students who they have responded to. You can then zoom in on a specific student by clicking on their name.
