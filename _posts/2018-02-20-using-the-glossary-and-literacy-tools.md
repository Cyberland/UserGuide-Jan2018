EduGuide has a new set of tools students can easily access to help them understand the vocabulary we use. Highlighting a word displays a definition of that word, and automatically saves the word inside a personal glossary the student can access by selecting My Glossary from the upper left menu. Students can also translate words into different languages.
<h1>How to Get a Definition</h1>
Highlight the word by clicking on the start or end of it and then, holding your mouse button, dragging your mouse until the word is highlighted. This will display the definition of the word. Words in the blue box can be defined, or students can check the definitions of their own words as they are entering them into the response field.

<h1>Translations</h1>
There are two buttons along the top of the dictionary overlay. Clicking on the arrow next to the language translator will open up a list of other languages available for translation. When you select a different language, the word equivalent for that language will be shown.

<h1>Viewing multiple words or phrase</h1>
When you highlight more than one word, the words or phrase will appear in the overlay. You may then click on each word to see its definition.

<h1>Viewing Your Glossary</h1>
You can view your glossary from the Path Menu by clicking on the three gray lines in the upper left corner, next to your profile picture. From your path, open up the sidebar and then click “My Glossary.” You will be taken to a page listing all of the words that you’ve looked up while working on your path.

You can remove words from the glossary by clicking on the “x” located to the far right of the word.
