<h2>Selecting “Time Invested”</h2>
<p>To view stats for time invested, select “Time Invested” from the list of metric view options located to the far left side of the screen.</p>
<h2>Timed Invested Averages</h2>
<p>The row along the top of the page will show the average amount of time spent by the users in the group or keyword that you’ve filtered for. If you click the icon or on the average time, a pop up message will appear which contains the total amount of time for the users listed in the filter.</p>
