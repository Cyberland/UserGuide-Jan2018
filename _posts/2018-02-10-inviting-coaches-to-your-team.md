When you need to invite a new coach to your team, you can do so from your team’s setup page. From anywhere on the site, open the main menu, then your team’s name, and then “Setup.” You will be taken to the setup page which lists the series of steps that needed to be completed when it launched. Expand “Invite Coaches” by clicking on its title.

<h2>Inviting Coaches</h2>
Enter your colleague’s email address into the field in the “User” column, and then use the dropdown menu under “Coach Role” to select the role that you would like them to fill on the team. Your choices will be Admin Coach, Captain, Lead Coach, and Support Coach. You can read a description of these team coach roles here.

After you have entered in the necessary information, click “Send Invite” to submit the invitation.
<h2>Joining the team</h2>
When your colleagues open up the invitation message, they will be prompted to accept by clicking on a button. They will be taken to the site where they are prompted to sign in or create a new account. Once they do, they will automatically be added to your team. Admin coaches are taken into the team setup page, while all other coaches are shown their path.

If Auto Groups is enabled, a group will be created for anyone who you invited as a lead coach. When lead coaches accept a team invitation, they are also automatically added to their group as a follower. The group name is also change so that it contains their first and last name.
