Today during a visit to the dentist, I noticed that all of the tools they were going to need while they were operating on my teeth--the scraper, the drill, the little mirror, the poker--were laid out carefully on a tray within reach of where my dentist was going to sitting. As my dentist got to work drilling into my tooth and putting in a filling, I thought a little bit about how navigation on a site should work a little bit like a doctor’s office. For dentists, or doctors in a surgery bay, the instruments they know they will need during a procedure are kept nearby. Anything else that they need while they are working is probably stored nearby in a drawer or a storage closet.

The main navigation on a site is a lot like the tray of medical instruments during a procedure: everything you need to get the job done. Hamburger menus are like virtual drawers, because they tend to contain everything else you might need.

Navigation has been on my mind lately following a discussion at work about how it could be improved on our site. Right now, we have a main menu which contains links to top level places, and then certain pages display sub navigation that is contextual. For example, when you are on the group management page, you can click sub navigation menu to navigate to Member Management or Coach Management.

Many of the questions I get from users, however, concern where they can go to accomplish certain things. This makes me wonder if storing so many of our links inside a collapsible main menu doesn’t make them visible enough.

A second purpose for a navigation is to teach a user what their choices are in the site, or serve as a guide which reminds them. So, invisibility is not a user’s friend, but neither is a static navigation that is so cluttered with choices that it is impractical. There needs to be a balance.

Looking at our site, it is broken up into smaller communities, which we call Teams. The typical user will belong to one team. Within each team, there are pages or sections such as a dashboard, goals, member management, coach management, and groups management. So, if someone does belong to more than one team, the real difference is in the names of the team that they belong to, but the page titles will stay the same. When you consider that most users belong to only one team, the most common action they would take is to navigate to pages within a given team. Navigating between teams would be rare even for the users who belong to multiple teams.

It seems to me that an improved structure for our navigation would be to put a user’s list of teams inside the hamburger menu styled “drawer,” and the links to pages within a given team would be presented in a static navigation menu shown in the header at the top of the page: dashboard, goals, members/coaches/groups management, etc. This does two things: it makes it easier for users to access these more commonly used pages, and instructs them on what their choices will be. Having the navigation in the header represent pages in the teams also keeps things consistent, because those pages are almost always offered. When they’re not, they would simply be hidden from the menu but that would be another user experience which stays consistent.

Right now the navigation for our site is handled by a dropdown menu which lists the teams that a user belongs to. The idea is that this helps them to navigate between teams and easily compare information, for example the members listed on a page or student progress in the path. But, the placement at the top and the permanence of the dropdown menu assumes that this is the action users will need to complete most often. It’s second purpose is to tell users what team they are on. This is important, but again it only matters if someone belongs to more than one team.

<i>What do you think about the current navigation on EduGuide’s website? Could it be structured differently? How would you design the navigation for a site like EduGuide?</i>
