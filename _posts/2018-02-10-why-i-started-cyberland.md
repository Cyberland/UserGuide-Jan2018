Over the years as I’ve worked on developing and launching UX Research and user testing campaigns, I’ve struggled with recruiting and managing participants. As I have hunted around for a solution, I’ve come across a lot of possibilities but none seemed to go far enough--or seemed economical.

Things reached a point where I began to think about building my own solution--somewhere that I could post information about the products being tested, share updates, and publish assignments. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that there must be other organizations around the same size of the one I work for who are also looking for an easy solution for their user testing needs.

So I wanted to invite anybody who is interested in user research, or the Internet in general, to check out a beta version of the website at http://cyberland.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com. I’ve set up the following features:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Blog </b>- for sharing general announcements, tips, and updates.</li>
 	<li><b>Discussion Forum</b> - Where visitors can post suggestions or bugs.</li>
 	<li><b>Questions Forum</b> - A place to post your questions about UX research or testing.</li>
 	<li><b>Web Links</b> - A library of recommended resources from around the Internet</li>
 	<li><b>Classified</b>s - For posting advertisements for testers</li>
 	<li><b>Sign up for an Email Newsletter</b></li>
</ul>
Members will have access to additional posts about specific companies. These will include assignments, knowledgebase articles, and development updates.

My goal is to write on Cyberland as if it is a detective agency. I chose the name because it sounds a bit about “Homeland,” a television show which features character who work for the CIA. I am hoping to make participation in the site feel a little like collecting clues and solving crimes. So, a blend between “Homeland,” and perhaps the movie “Tron.”

I’m open to any ideas or suggestions on how to make the site better. Visitors are welcome to post their feedback <a href="http://cyberland.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com/forum?view=forum&amp;id=4">inside a forum located here</a>.

In the addition to needing participants, I am looking for bloggers and moderators who are interested in helping me to grow this site into a bustling community.
