<p>If the feature is enabled for the team, students are invited to subscribe to SMS Notifications after their first day working on the path. When they log in, a message will appear on-screen which asks them to enable SMS notifications and to enter in their cell phone number.</p>

<p>When a student subscribes to SMS notifications, they will receive notices via text message of comments posted in their path activities or on their personal dashboard. As time goes on, the site will also send them reminders and occasional nudges when a new path activity becomes available to them. Notices are also sent out via sms if the student doesnâ€™t log back into their account after a few days.</p>
<h2>Managing SMS Notifications</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Users can turn SMS Notifications on or off from their personal settings page inside their account. They can also enter or change their cell phone number inside the Profile section of the settings page.</p>
