<h1>Registration, Account login, and General Troubleshooting</h1>
<h1>Roles and Privileges on the site</h1>
There are two common levels of membership on the site; member or limited member. Members will have access to their personal profile, personal goals, and a “My Teams” page. When a member is a team member, they can access most pages of the team, although coaches can customize some team features.

Restricted members can access their personal profile section which includes their personal dashboard, personal settings and personal goals. They can be members on a team, but the team pages are hidden from them.
<h1>Joining a Team</h1>
Someone will typically be invited to join a team either via a URL or a join code. The main difference is that when they are given a join code, they will need to navigate to http://join.eduguide.org and then enter the code in manually. When they use the URL, the code is pre-populated in the form.

When the user uses a join code, three things happen. Their account on the site is immediately created, bypassing any need for them to verify their information, and they are automatically approved for membership in the team. This is based on the assumption that they have permission from a coach to join the team if they were able to enter the right code.
<h2>Group Join Codes</h2>
The third action depends on the join code itself. Join codes are typically used to separate new members into groups as they join the team. Only join codes for Coach and Mentors will allow users to join a team and become a coach or a mentor in one step. The Member join code and custom join codes assign new members to the role of Member as they join the team. Students will become restricted members as they join the team.
<h2>Team Orientation</h2>
Regular members will also see the New Member Orientation screen when they join a team. During orientation, they will be prompted to enter their vision statement, and upload an avatar. There is also a series of tooltips which will point out key functionality inside the team. Limited members are not taken through the team orientation.
<h1>Account Login</h1>
Once someone is a member of EduGuide, they can log into their account by navigating to http://login.eduguide.org and entering their username (email address) and password. It is better to use this URL instead of http://www.eduguide.org.

The site will behave differently based on the member’s status on the site. If they are a regular member, they will automatically be taken to their personal dashboard inside their personal profile. Restricted Members, however, will be automatically routed to a path.
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
There are a number of steps that a member of site can take when they run into an issue logging into their account.
<h3>Confirm that you are entering in your username and password correctly</h3>
When your email address or password is rejected, double check the characters you’ve entered in for a typo. Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to view your password, so you would need to re-enter it.

Sometimes, problems come up when a user has created multiple accounts on the site or mistyped their email address during registration. We’ve been seeing this happen especially with students.There isn’t really isn’t a way to determine if this is the case, although a team coach can help.

For teachers and coaches, when a student runs into an issue logging into their account, it might help to verify their email address and password.
<h3>Initiate a Password Reset</h3>
Click “Forgot Password?” to be taken to a page where you can enter in the email address you had used to register the account. You will be sent an email prompting you to reset your password by clicking on a URL.

This page can also be used to confirm that a student has successfully created an account on the site using the email address they’ve provided you. If you enter the email address and the system says that it can’t find a match, then there is a chance that they have entered their email address incorrectly.
<h3>Asking your Team Coach to reset your password</h3>
Coaches can reset a member’s password on their behalf using the Member Management page. This especially comes in handy for students.
