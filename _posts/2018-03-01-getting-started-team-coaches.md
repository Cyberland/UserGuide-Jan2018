<h1>Joining EduGuide</h1>
Review the differences and similarities for the join process for Team Coaches and Team Members, your students, as you begin to work on your EduGuide team.
<h2>Coaches Joining EduGuide</h2>
Only Admin Coaches and Team Captains can use the Invite Coaches tool in the Setup option in the Main Menu to invite other Team Coaches using their email address.

Once Team Coaches’ emails have been entered and an invitation sent by Admin Coaches or Team Captains using the Setup Tool, other Team Coaches can access the team.

Each Team Coach will receive automatic reminders to join the team until done.

Using the Invite Coaches tool gives Team Coaches full access to the platform.

Do not use the Invite Coaches Tool for students since they should join as Team Members with restricted access to keep accounts private from students on the team.
<h2>Students Joining EduGuide</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students join the team with a 7-digit invitation code.</li>
</ul>
The 7-digit invitation code is generated when each group is created.
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
 	<li>Go to the Main Menu and click on Groups, and the Group Management Page appears.
<ul>
 	<li>If the Auto Groups feature is ON, then each Lead Coach has 1 group automatically created for them as they join the team.
This gives each Lead Group 1 group with a specific 7-digit invitation code for students who are working with them to use to join the team and that group.</li>
 	<li>If the Auto Group feature is OFF, then Admin Coaches and Team Captains can create groups as needed (by grade, teacher, class, etc.) to generate the 7-digit invitation code for students to join the team through that specific group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
