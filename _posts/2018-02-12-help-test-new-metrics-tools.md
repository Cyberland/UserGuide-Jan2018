I am looking for volunteers who are available to help me test some new metrics tools on our staging site. The metrics will help our coaches view stats for the categories Time Invested and Words Learned.

In order for me to test, new activity needs to be generated inside the path on the staging site.
<h2>Joining the Site</h2>
You can get started on a path by first joining the test team “Space Zebra” on the staging site. You will join as a student, so as soon as you are a member of the team you will be taken into the path. The following URL will allow you to join:

https://staging.eduguide.org/join/?invitationCode=4917019
<h3>Time Invested</h3>
For Time Invested, I only need each volunteer to complete 1-5 activities in the path. If you want to change things up, try taking long pauses in the middle of activities. If you have behaved in a certain way, please let me know.
<h3>Words Learned</h3>
“Words Learned” relates to the number of words which students look up definitions for as a part of our glossary feature. As students view a step in an activity, they can highlight a word that they don’t understand and see a definition. In some cases, they can also play audio which demonstrates how to pronounce the word. Each word that they define is automatically stored inside their personal glossary, which is accessible from the menu on the side.

The system tracks the number of words stored in students’ glossaries, and this view will display the stats to coaches.

As you complete your path, please try to look up the definitions for 10-15 words.
<h2>Sharing Feedback</h2>
While you are on the site, you can open a ticket for any questions or issues you have about the feature. Just click on “Help &amp; Feedback” inside the main menu. You can also send an email to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.

Members of Cyberland can also submit feedback inside the forum for EduGuide located inside the site. To join Cyberland, complete the <a href="http://cyberland.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com">registration form here</a>.

You can also chat with the helpdesk during business hours by clicking on “Chat with us” in the main menu.
