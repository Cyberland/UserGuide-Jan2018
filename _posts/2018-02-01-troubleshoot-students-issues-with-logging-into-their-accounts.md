<p>There are a number of common mistakes or issues which can prevent students from being able to access their accounts:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Typos in email address or password</b> - Ask students to double check how they are entering in their account credentials. If you can, confirm that they are entering in their email address correctly. Ask the student if they are entering the email address exactly the same way that they had entered it during registration.</li>
<li><b>Duplicate accounts</b> - Sometimes, students will create a second account. If they seem to be entering in the correct information but are still having issues, ask them if they registered more than once. It is possible that they are using the wrong email address/password combination.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If the student appears to be entering in their information correctly and there are no signs of a bigger issue, there are ways to quickly resolve their issues with logging in:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Look up the student in the Members page by clicking on the option menu located next to their name. The email address they used to register their account will appear in the menu.</li>
<li>Click “Edit Membership” to view their team membership information, and enter a new password for their account. Tell them to log in using the password. Encourage them to change their password from their My Settings page once they’ve logged in.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
