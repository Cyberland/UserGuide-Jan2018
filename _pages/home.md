Cyberland's purpose is to dive deep into the designs and rules of website and identify any usability weaknesses. Visitors on the site can explore forums, a Classifieds section, a list of recommended web resources, and a public blog. Community members will be able to access a member-only blog, complete testing assignments, and more. Cyberland is also hoping to partner with other businesses or organizations who would like to gather feedback on their websites.
